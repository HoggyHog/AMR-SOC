# AMR-SOC

I have completed week 1 and week2 and am currently working on week 3 material of OpenCV, and Tensorflow through the resources shared to us. The reason for me lagging behind is that I've been preparing for my mids and endsems for the last month, and to add to that moving over to campus and adjusting here also took some time. But nevertheless I will give it my all my time as soon as Im done with my endsems this 30th, and complete it before the deadline
